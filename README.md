# **Final Project: Air Quality Analysis and Prediction**
This project was conducted by a group of students from MECE E4520: Data Science For Mechanical Systems at Columbia University.

## **Project Description**
This project uses advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict air pollution levels. The study investigates pollutant concentration trends and temporal variations in an urban environment by leveraging real-world air quality data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project also explores methods for developing accurate predictive models to support environmental management strategies.

## **Objectives**
1. Monitor pollutant concentrations in real time and assess air quality levels.
2. Develop predictive models to forecast pollution levels.

## **Key Findings**
1. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Higher levels of NOx and NO2 are observed during rush hours and weekdays, correlating with traffic patterns.
   - Pollutant distributions revealed log-normal and normal patterns, offering insights into their behavior over time.

2. **Modeling Outcomes**:
   - Linear regression showed limitations in capturing the complexities of air quality data.
   - Neural networks proved effective for non-linear relationships, significantly outperforming simpler models.
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hyperparameter tuning were critical for improving model accuracy and reducing complexity.

## **Data Sources**
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Air Quality Dataset (March 2004 to February 2005).
  - Pollutants: CO, NMHC, Benzene, NOx, and NO2.
  - Data collected using metal oxide sensors embedded in an air quality monitoring device.
